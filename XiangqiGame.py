# Description: This script is a Xiangqi Game, with supporting classes and functions.
#              It includes the main class, XiangqiGame, that manages and initializes the game,
#              starting with red player.  There is a super class of GamePiece, and additional
#              sub-classes game piece classes, represent their unique rules for moving.
#              The XiangqiGame class manages the board progress using a dictionary, where the
#              keys represent the location of pieces and the values are the particular GamePiece
#              class at that location.
#              Locations within the program are stored as tuples of index notation, representing
#              the horizontal and vertical (col, row) positions, starting from the red sides
#              left corner if the board were arranged (as seen from above the board) with the
#              red player as the top and black as the bottom.  Users by default are assumed to use
#              algebraic notation, but have the option with board methods to also use index notation.

#              The main function provides an interactive way to play the game or to test functionality
#              of the program.  This script introduces two exceptions class for handling algebraic
#              notation errors and a class for player name input errors.  The main function 'PLAY' option
#              is supported by some of the display methods found in the XiangqiGame class.
